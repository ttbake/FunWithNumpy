        <p>The mustang is a free-roaming horse of the American west that first descended from horses brought to the
          Americas by the Spanish. Mustangs are often referred to as wild horses, but because they are descended from
          once-domesticated horses, they are properly defined as feral horses. The original mustangs were Colonial
          Spanish horses, but many other breeds and types of horses contributed to the modern mustang, resulting in
          varying phenotypes. Most contain a greater genetic mixture of ranch stock and more recent breed releases,
          while a few are relatively unchanged from the original Iberian stock, most strongly represented in the most
          isolated populations.</p>
        <p>In 1971, the United States Congress recognized that "wild free-roaming horses and burros are living symbols
          of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West, which continue to contribute to the diversity of life forms
          within the Nation and enrich the lives of the American people." The free-roaming mustang population is managed
          and protected by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Controversy surrounds the sharing of land and resources
          by the free-ranging mustangs with the livestock of the ranching industry, and also with the methods with which
          the federal government manages the wild population numbers. The most common method of population management
          used is rounding up excess population then offering them to adoption by private individuals. There are
          inadequate numbers of adopters, so many animals now live in temporary and long-term holding areas with
          concerns that the animals may be sold for horse meat. Additional debate centers on the question of whether
          mustangs—and horses in general—are a native species or an introduced invasive species.</p>
